# Structures and File IO(Exercise 10)
  This assignment is to understand how to 
  declare and manipulate structures 
  including an array of structures.
  
  The input and output in this program is 
  done by program using file operations. 
  This program uses basic file io. 
# Required Files To Download : 
  1.) Input File(input_file.txt)
  
  2.) Required C Code file(structures.c)
  
  Click on the links given above to 
  download required files.   
# Functions in structures.c :
  sorting() function is used to sort the array of structures based on the id's of students. In this code selection sort is used to sort the array. This works by selecting the   relatively smaller element and replacing it larger one.      
# How to implement assignment:
  1.) Download above given files in same 
      directory.
      
  2.) Open terminal and go to the directory 
      where you have saved that files.
      
  3.) Write below given commands:
      1.) gcc structures.c
      
      2.) ./a.out
      
      3.) Code is executed and to see output open the output_file.txt or use command cat output.txt
